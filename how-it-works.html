                        <p class="content">
                            Is It Up? makes use of the <a href="http://bulma.io/" target="_blank">Bulma</a> CSS framework for its display paradigms. The main 'ping' functionality was originally designed by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/429938/trante">Trante</a>, and published on <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/GSSCD" target="_blank">JS Fiddle</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="title is-3">The Ping Function</h3>
                        <p class="content">
                             The ping function opens a connection to the remote server, and attempts to load an image file. Any response to this request (even an error response) is considered a 'successful' ping. This means that the application may not work well behind proxies that implement their own 'page not found' functionality. A failure to respond at all classes as a 'failed' ping. Once the first three pings have been completed, the server status is displayed as either 'up' or 'down'. 
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="title is-3">Persistence</h3>
                        <p class="content">
                             Is It Up? saves your server list in your browser's local storage. This is not a guaranteed or reliable location to store data, but it allows for some degree of persistence between browser sessions.  
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="title is-3">Limitations</h3>
                        <p class="content">
                             Is It Up? will function poorly on slow network connections. This is because a time limit of 1.9 seconds is used for each ping request. Higher values resulted in false positives. In case the request is still 'in-flight' after 1.9 seconds, a false negative will be returned. There is a degree of tolerance built in - only in case of three consecutive failed pings does the server show as down. Three consecutive 'successful' pings will result in the server being flagged as 'up' again.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="title is-3">Notifications</h3>
                        <p class="content">
                             Is It Up? will notify you with a Chrome notification when a server goes down. You can turn these notifications off if you like, using the checkbox underneath the 'Add new server' form. 
                        </p>
